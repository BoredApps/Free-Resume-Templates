## Functional Resume 
A functional resume focuses on skills and experience rather than on chronological work history. This resume is useful to those who have had an occasional gap in employment but have consistently improved their skills. 

It's also useful for those who have relevant skills for a field or industry but little to no job experience in that industry.
 This template can be modified to suit your specific background and the job you're targeting. Remember, the key is to focus on skills and experiences that align with the job requirements.

Here's a template you can use as a starting point:
