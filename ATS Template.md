# ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Resume Format

Formatting your resume for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) is crucial in today's job market. Here's a template you can use as a guideline. Remember, the key to an ATS-friendly resume is simplicity in format, clear section headings, and the use of keywords relevant to the job description.

Formatting Tips:
* Use a clean, straightforward font like Arial or Times New Roman.
* Use bullet points for clarity.
* Keep your font size between 10 and 12 points.
