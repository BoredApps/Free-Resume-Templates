# Human Readable Resume Format 

When crafting a resume for human readers, you have more flexibility to use design elements and a narrative style. The focus here is on readability, visual appeal, and storytelling, while still maintaining professionalism. 

**Design and Formatting Tips:**
* Choose a clean, professional font, but you can be slightly more creative than for ATS (e.g., Calibri, Garamond).
* Use a slightly larger font for your name and section headings for emphasis.
* Incorporate subtle color accents if desired, but maintain high readability.
* Use bullet points, bolding, and italics strategically to highlight key information.
* Ensure there is sufficient white space to make the document easy to scan.
* If including links (like LinkedIn), make sure they are live in the digital version of your resume.

This format allows for a more personal touch and showcases your professional story in an engaging manner. It's ideal for situations where you know a human will be the primary reader, such as when handing a resume directly to a hiring manager or in networking situations.
