# STAR Resume Format

The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is a structured way of presenting your experiences and accomplishments, particularly in the work experience section of your resume. 

### Formatting Tips:
*  Use a clean, simple font like Arial or Times New Roman.
*  Keep your font size between 10 and 12 points.
*  Avoid using tables or graphics as they may not be ATS-friendly.
*  Use standard section titles like "Work Experience," "Education," and "Skills."
*  Save your resume in a .docx or .pdf format to ensure compatibility with ATS systems.

This template leverages the STAR method to create impactful and specific descriptions of your experiences, which is especially useful for behavioral interview questions and making your resume stand out to employers.
